## üß™ How to Test the Agent SDK

### Step 1: Create an Account / Sign In

1. Go to **http://localhost:3000/auth/signup** (or click "Sign Up")
2. Create a new account with:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Password: (your password)
3. Or sign in if you already have an account: **http://localhost:3000/auth/signin**

### Step 2: Navigate to Resume Dashboard

1. After signing in, you'll be redirected to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**
2. Click on "**Resume**" or navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard/resume**

### Step 3: Upload a Resume (Triggers Agent SDK)

1. **Upload a resume file** (PDF or DOCX)
2. **Paste a job description** (or job URL from LinkedIn)
3. Click **"Optimize Resume"**

**What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
```
User clicks "Optimize"
    ‚Üì
Frontend sends request to /api/agent/run (or /api/upload-resume)
    ‚Üì
Agent SDK Runtime kicks in:
  1. Intent Detection ‚Üí "optimize"
  2. Job Link Scraper ‚Üí fetches job details (if URL provided)
  3. Resume Writer ‚Üí analyzes and improves content
  4. ATS Scoring ‚Üí calculates match percentage
  5. Design Ops ‚Üí applies theme/styling
  6. Layout Engine ‚Üí renders preview
  7. Versioning ‚Üí saves resume version
  8. History Store ‚Üí records optimization
    ‚Üì
Response returns AgentResult:
  - intent: "optimize"
  - diffs: [list of changes made]
  - ats_report: {score: 85, missing_keywords: [...]}
  - artifacts: {resume_json, preview_pdf_path}
  - ui_prompts: [any warnings or suggestions]
    ‚Üì
Frontend displays:
  - ATS match score
  - Optimized resume preview
  - Key improvements
  - Missing keywords
```

---

## üìä What to Observe

### In the Browser

1. **ATS Score**
   - Should see a percentage match score (e.g., "85% Match")
   - This is calculated by the Agent SDK's ATS tool

2. **Resume Preview**
   - Optimized resume with applied design
   - Rendered by the Layout Engine tool

3. **Improvements Section**
   - List of key improvements made
   - Generated from the diffs array

4. **Missing Keywords**
   - Keywords from job description not in resume
   - Extracted by the ATS tool

### In the Server Logs

Open your terminal where the server is running and watch for:

```
Agent SDK Log Examples:

‚úÖ {"t":"2025-10-23T...", "category":"agent_run", "message":"agent run completed", "meta":{"userId":"...", "intent":"optimize"}}

‚úÖ {"t":"2025-10-23T...", "category":"tool_error", "message":"ATS score used a safe fallback...", ...}
   ^ This is normal! Fallbacks are working as designed

‚úÖ {"t":"2025-10-23T...", "category":"storage_warn", "message":"LayoutEngine.render PDF/storage failed", ...}
   ^ Also normal if Supabase storage isn't fully configured
```

### In the Network Tab (Browser DevTools)

1. Open **Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Click "Optimize" in the app
4. Look for the request:

```
POST /api/agent/run  (or /api/upload-resume)
Status: 200 OK
Response Preview:
{
  "intent": "optimize",
  "actions": [
    {"tool": "JobLinkScraper.getJob", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Fetch job details"},
    {"tool": "ResumeWriter.applyDiff", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Add extracted skills"},
    {"tool": "DesignOps.theme", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Apply requested theme"},
    {"tool": "ATS.score", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Compute ATS score"},
    {"tool": "LayoutEngine.render", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Render preview"},
    {"tool": "Versioning.commit", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Create version"},
    {"tool": "HistoryStore.save", "args": {...}, "rationale": "Record run"}
  ],
  "diffs": [
    {"scope": "paragraph", "before": "...", "after": "..."},
    {"scope": "style", "before": "", "after": "font=Arial; color=2563eb"}
  ],
  "artifacts": {
    "resume_json": { /* optimized resume data */ },
    "preview_pdf_path": "artifacts/...",
    "export_files": [{"type": "pdf", "path": "..."}]
  },
  "ats_report": {
    "score": 85,
    "missing_keywords": ["Python", "AWS", "Docker"],
    "recommendations": ["Consider adding keyword: Python", ...]
  },
  "history_record": {
    "resume_version_id": "...",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-23T...",
    "ats_score": 85
  },
  "ui_prompts": []
}
```

## üîç Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Intent Detection

Try different commands in chat (if chat feature is available):

```
Commands to try:
- "optimize my resume for software engineering"
  ‚Üí Intent: "optimize"

- "change the font to Helvetica"
  ‚Üí Intent: "design", "layout"

- "add skills: Python, AWS, Docker"
  ‚Üí Intent: "optimize"
  ‚Üí Should see diffs with added skills

- "strengthen my summary"
  ‚Üí Intent: "strengthen"
  ‚Üí Should see paragraph diffs
```

### Scenario 2: Test Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Without Supabase Connection** (current state):
   - Agent SDK should still work
   - Will log warnings for Versioning and HistoryStore
   - Should return fallback IDs (e.g., `local_1234567890`)
   - UI should still function normally

2. **With Invalid Job URL**:
   - JobLinkScraper should fail gracefully
   - Should continue with empty job text
   - No crash, just logged warning

### Scenario 3: Test Design Tools

1. Upload resume
2. Try different design templates
3. Observe:
   - DesignOps.theme tool in actions array
   - Style diffs in response
   - Different font/color applied in preview

### Scenario 4: View History

1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard/history**
2. Should see previous optimization runs
3. Each entry stored by HistoryStore tool

- [ ] Can create account / sign in
- [ ] Can upload resume file
- [ ] Can paste job description
- [ ] Optimize button triggers API call

- [ ] Intent detection working (check response.intent)
- [ ] Actions array populated (7-10 tools executed)
- [ ] Diffs array shows changes made
- [ ] ATS score calculated and displayed
- [ ] Resume preview renders

- [ ] Response has `diffs` array
- [ ] Response has `artifacts` object
- [ ] Response has `ats_report` object
- [ ] Response has `history_record` object
- [ ] Response has `ui_prompts` array

### Fallback Behavior

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Agent SDK disabled" error
**Solution**: Check `.env.local`:
```env
AGENT_SDK_ENABLED=true   # Must be true
```

### Issue: Getting legacy response shape
**Solution**: Check `.env.local`:
```env
AGENT_SDK_SHADOW=false   # Must be false
```

### Issue: Authentication errors
**Solution**: Make sure you're signed in:
1. Go to /auth/signin
2. Use valid credentials
3. Check browser cookies

### Issue: Server not responding
**Solution**: Restart the server:
```bash
cd resume-builder-ai
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Can't see logs
**Solution**: Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

## üìä Expected Behavior vs Old Behavior

### Old System (Legacy Optimizer)
```json
{
  "optimizationId": "abc-123",
  "optimizedResume": { /* data */ },
  "matchScore": 85
}
```

### New System (Agent SDK) ‚úÖ ACTIVE NOW
```json
{
  "intent": "optimize",
  "actions": [7 tools executed],
  "diffs": [changes made],
  "artifacts": {resume, preview, exports},
  "ats_report": {score, keywords, recommendations},
  "history_record": {version_id, timestamp},
  "ui_prompts": [warnings/suggestions]
}
```

**Key Differences**:
- ‚úÖ More detailed action log
- ‚úÖ Explicit diffs showing changes
- ‚úÖ Better ATS analysis
- ‚úÖ History tracking
- ‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Intent detection

---

## üéØ Success Indicators

You'll know the Agent SDK is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ Response contains `intent` field (not just `optimizationId`)
2. ‚úÖ Response contains `actions` array with 7+ tool executions
3. ‚úÖ Response contains `diffs` array with actual changes
4. ‚úÖ ATS score is calculated and returned
5. ‚úÖ Server logs show `{"category":"agent_run", "message":"agent run completed"}`
6. ‚úÖ No 501 "Agent SDK disabled" errors
7. ‚úÖ No response shape `{shadow: true, legacy: {...}}`

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check server logs** - Look for error messages
2. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors
3. **Check Network tab** - Verify API request/response
4. **Check .env.local** - Verify Agent SDK flags
5. **Restart server** - `npm run dev`
