# ‚ö†Ô∏è USER ACTION REQUIRED - Clear Browser Cache

## The 406 Error is FIXED in Code, But You Need to Clear Your Cache

Good news! The root cause of the 406 error has been identified and fixed. However, your browser is still using **cached JavaScript from the old version**.

## Why You're Still Seeing the Error

Even though the code is fixed:
- Your browser cached the old JavaScript files
- These old files are making the bad queries
- Until you clear your cache, your browser will keep using the old code

## How to Fix It (Takes 30 seconds)

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Try This First) ‚ö°

This is the fastest method:

**Windows/Linux:**
1. Make sure you're on the optimization page showing the error
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Ctrl + F5`)
3. Wait for the page to fully reload

**macOS:**
1. Make sure you're on the optimization page showing the error
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. Wait for the page to fully reload

**What this does:** Bypasses cache and forces fresh download of all files.

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache (If Hard Refresh Doesn't Work) üóëÔ∏è

**Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select **"Cached images and files"** only
3. Choose **"All time"** from the dropdown
4. Click **"Clear data"**
5. Reload the page

**Mozilla Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select **"Cache"** only
3. Choose **"Everything"** from the dropdown
4. Click **"Clear Now"**
5. Reload the page

**Safari:**
1. Press `Cmd + Option + E` to empty caches
2. Or: Develop menu ‚Üí Empty Caches
3. Reload the page

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode (100% Guaranteed) üïµÔ∏è

This guarantees you'll get fresh code:

1. Open a new incognito/private window:
   - **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + N` (Mac)
   - **Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
   - **Safari:** `Cmd + Shift + N`

2. Log into the application in the incognito window
3. Navigate to your optimization
4. The error should be gone

## How to Verify It's Fixed

After clearing cache, you should see:

‚úÖ No 406 error when viewing optimizations
‚úÖ Optimization page loads completely
‚úÖ You can view your optimized resume
‚úÖ Chat functionality works
‚úÖ Design customization works

## If You Still See the Error

If you've tried all the above and still see the error:

### Advanced: Clear All Site Data

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Click the **lock icon** (or info icon) in the address bar
2. Click **"Site settings"**
3. Scroll down and click **"Clear data"**
4. Confirm and reload

**Firefox:**
1. Right-click the page ‚Üí **"Inspect"**
2. Go to **"Storage"** tab
3. Right-click on the domain ‚Üí **"Delete All"**
4. Reload the page

### Last Resort: Different Browser

Try opening the application in a completely different browser (if you were using Chrome, try Firefox, etc.). This guarantees no cached code.

## What We Fixed (Technical Details)

For your reference, here's what was changed in the code:

1. ‚úÖ **Build ID Cache Busting** - Every deployment now generates unique file names
2. ‚úÖ **Cache Headers** - Added aggressive no-cache headers to prevent stale code
3. ‚úÖ **Error Boundary** - If you see a 406 error, you'll now see helpful instructions automatically
4. ‚úÖ **Query Pattern** - Fixed the underlying Supabase query to prevent 406 errors

## Need Help?

If none of these solutions work:

1. Take a screenshot of the error
2. Note which browser and version you're using
3. Try these in DevTools:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for requests to `supabase.co`
   - Screenshot any that show 406 status
4. Report the issue with these details

## Questions?

**Q: Will I lose my data if I clear cache?**
A: No! Clearing cache only removes downloaded files like JavaScript and images. Your account data, resumes, and optimizations are stored on the server and won't be affected.

**Q: Do I need to do this every time?**
A: No! This is a one-time fix. Once you clear your cache and get the new code, you won't have this issue again (unless we deploy another major update, in which case we'll notify you).

**Q: What if I'm on mobile?**
A: The same principles apply:
- **iPhone Safari:** Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Clear History and Website Data
- **Android Chrome:** Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Cached images and files

**Status:** Code is fixed ‚úÖ | User cache clear required ‚è≥

**Next Steps:**
1. Clear your browser cache using one of the methods above
2. Reload the application
3. Verify the 406 error is gone
4. Continue using the application normally

**Estimated Time:** 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on method chosen
