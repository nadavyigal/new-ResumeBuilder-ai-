   - `a2f3eb4` - docs: add deployment verification tools for ATS v2 features
   - OR `51dd3ab` - feat: add ATS score improvements and update optimization page UI

5. **Check deployment status**:
   - ✅ **Ready** = Deployed successfully
   - 🔄 **Building** = Wait 3-5 minutes
   - ❌ **Error** = Click to see build logs

6. **If deployment succeeded**, proceed to "Verify Production" section below

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Seeing Old Version

**Cause**: Browser cache or CDN cache

**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh (see above)
2. Clear all browser data for your site
3. Try in incognito/private window
4. Try different browser
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN cache to expire

### Issue: Deployment Failed

**Cause**: Build error or missing dependencies

**Solutions**:
1. Click on failed deployment in Vercel dashboard
2. Check build logs for errors
3. Common fixes:
   - Ensure all files are committed
   - Check `package.json` has all dependencies
   - Verify no TypeScript errors

### Issue: "Details" Button Not Showing

**Cause**: Using legacy ATS v1 data

**Solution**:
- This is expected for old optimizations
- Create a new optimization to see ATS v2 features
- v1 scores will still show but without detailed breakdown

### Issue: ATS Score Card Not Appearing

**Cause**: Missing component import or data

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify deployment included commit `8942642` or later
3. Check that optimization has `match_score` in database
