# Vercel Deployment Error Diagnosis

**Time**: 20:30  
**Status**: Waiting for error details

## Common Vercel Deployment Errors

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 2. Module Not Found Errors
- Missing imports
- Incorrect import paths
- Missing dependencies in package.json

### 3. Runtime Errors
- Async/await issues
- Null pointer exceptions
- Type errors at runtime

## To Get Error Details

Please share the exact error messages from Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Click on "View Function Logs" or "Build Logs"
4. Copy the error messages (the lines in red)
5. Share them here

## Temporary Workaround

If you want to bypass the ATS v2 scoring temporarily to get deployment working:

1. Comment out the ATS scoring in `/api/optimize`
2. Deploy without ATS v2
3. Fix ATS errors separately
4. Re-enable ATS v2

## Likely Issues

Based on the code, the most likely errors are:

1. **OpenAI API calls failing** - The ATS scoring uses embeddings
2. **Missing dependencies** - Some npm package not installed
3. **Environment variables** - Missing API keys

Please share the exact error messages so I can fix them precisely.
