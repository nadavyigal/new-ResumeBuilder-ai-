## Vercel Deployment Status

### GitHub Integration

- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment progress

**Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Find the latest deployment (should be commit 51dd3ab)
4. If not deployed, click "Redeploy" on the latest production deployment

**Option 3: Clear Cache**
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings
2. Navigate to "Build & Development Settings"
3. Click "Clear Cache"
4. Trigger a new deployment

**Option 4: Hard Refresh Browser**
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- This clears browser cache that might show old version
