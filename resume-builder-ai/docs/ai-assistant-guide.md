## Tips & Best Practices

### Content Modifications

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific about which field you want to change
- Use natural language (the AI understands!)
- Review changes in the preview before downloading
- Check the modification history

❌ **Don't:**

- Request changes to non-existent fields
- Modify the same field multiple times rapidly

### Visual Customization

✅ **Do:**
- Choose high-contrast color combinations

- Test how it looks in PDF before finalizing
- Consider the industry (creative vs. corporate)

❌ **Don't:**
- Use too many colors (stick to 2-3)
- Ignore accessibility warnings
- Choose fonts that are hard to read
- Use bright/neon colors for professional resumes

### General Tips

1. **Start Small** - Make one change at a time
2. **Review Changes** - Check the preview after each modification
3. **Use History** - You can revert changes if needed
4. **Download Often** - Save versions as you go
5. **Ask Questions** - The AI can explain what it's doing
