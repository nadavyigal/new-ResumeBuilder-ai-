Hey everyone - quick favor. I have been building a free ATS resume checker on nights and weekends because I kept hearing the same story: "I am qualified, but I never hear back."

The tool compares your resume to a job description and highlights the biggest gaps. It is still early, and I am doing a soft launch Monday, so I would love honest feedback on what feels helpful vs. confusing.

If you have 5 minutes, try it here: https://resumelybuilderai.com

If you do, please tell me:
1) Was it easy to use?
2) Did the feedback feel accurate?
3) What would you change?

Thanks in advance - happy to return feedback on anything you are shipping.
