Subject: Quick favor? New resume ATS checker I built

Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something I have been building on nights and weekends. A bunch of friends told me their resumes were getting rejected by ATS systems even when they were qualified, so I put together a simple tool that scores your resume against a job description and explains the top gaps.

Earlier this year I watched a close friend apply to 40 roles and get almost nothing back. We tweaked her resume and she started getting responses. That gap between effort and results felt wrong, so I decided to build a tool that makes the ATS part visible.

It is called Resumely, and it includes a free ATS score checker (no signup required). The goal is to help people spot what an ATS is actually looking for and make fast, practical fixes.

If you have 5 minutes, would you mind trying it and telling me:
1) Was it easy to use?
2) Did the feedback feel accurate?
3) What would you change or remove?

I am doing a soft launch on Monday, so your honest feedback would help a lot. If you are working on anything and want a second set of eyes, I am happy to return the favor.

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
