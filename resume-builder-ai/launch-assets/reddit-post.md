Title: I kept getting ATS rejections, so I built a free checker - looking for feedback

Body:

I have been job hunting on and off this year and kept hearing the same thing from friends: "I know I am qualified, but I never hear back." After watching a close friend apply to 40 roles with almost no responses, we revised her resume to match the job description more closely and suddenly she started getting interviews.

That made me realize how invisible ATS filtering is. So I built a simple, free ATS score checker that compares your resume to a job description and shows the biggest gaps. It is meant to be practical, not magic. I am doing a soft launch and would love honest feedback from people who actually use these tools.

If you want value without using the tool, here are 5 quick ATS tips I learned while building it:
1) Use the exact job title language where it makes sense (ATS look for title alignment).
2) Put core skills in a dedicated Skills section AND show them in experience bullets.
3) Avoid tables, columns, and text boxes - they often break parsing.
4) Use consistent dates and simple bullets.
5) Match the top 8-12 keywords from the job description, then back them up with results.

If you want to try the checker, here is the link (no signup required): https://resumelybuilderai.com

If you are a recruiter or hiring manager, I would especially value your take on whether the feedback sounds realistic. If you are job hunting, tell me if the suggestions are actionable or if they miss the mark.

If you do try it, I would love to know:
- Was the score or feedback useful?
- Did anything feel wrong or misleading?
- What would make it more helpful?

I am not selling anything here. I just want to make this useful before I share it more widely. Happy to take criticism and fix what is broken.
