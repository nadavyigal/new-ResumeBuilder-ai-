# Feature Specification: AI Chat Resume Iteration

**Feature Branch**: `002-when-user-optimized`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when user optimized the resume i would like to add a chat with ai option so user can iterate and amend the resume for example add skilles ect"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature enables iterative resume refinement through conversational AI
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: job seekers with optimized resumes; Actions: chat, iterate, amend, add skills; Data: conversation history, resume versions; Constraints: post-optimization context
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Chat interface type: sidebar panel on right side of resume view page
   ‚Üí Conversation persistence: 30-day retention period
   ‚Üí AI model selection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: same OpenAI model as optimization or different?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: view optimized resume ‚Üí open chat ‚Üí request changes ‚Üí see updated resume
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 16 testable requirements covering chat interface, AI interaction, resume updates, conversation management
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Chat sessions, messages, resume versions, amendment requests
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties around chat UI placement and data retention"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: UI placement - modal overlay, sidebar panel, or separate page? ‚Üí A: Right side of the optimized resume page (sidebar panel)
- Q: Response time target for AI chat responses? ‚Üí A: 7 seconds (note: actual resume changes may take longer to process and display)
- Q: Retention period for chat history - 30 days, indefinitely, or user-controlled deletion? ‚Üí A: 30 days

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A job seeker has just received an AI-optimized resume tailored to a specific job posting. They want to further refine the resume by adding specific skills they forgot to include, rewording certain experience descriptions for better impact, or adjusting the format. Instead of manually editing or re-uploading, they open a chat interface where they can conversationally request changes like "add Python and Docker to my skills section" or "make my project manager experience sound more leadership-focused," and see their resume update in real-time with each AI-powered amendment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed resume optimization, **When** they view their optimized resume, **Then** they see a clear option to "Chat with AI to refine resume"
2. **Given** a user opens the chat interface, **When** they type "add Java and AWS to my technical skills", **Then** the AI processes the request and updates the resume to include those skills in the appropriate section
3. **Given** a user has made multiple chat amendments, **When** they review their conversation history, **Then** they can see all previous requests and resulting changes with timestamps
4. **Given** a user is satisfied with chat-based changes, **When** they close the chat, **Then** the updated resume is saved as a new version linked to the original optimization
5. **Given** a user requests a change that would fabricate experience, **When** the AI processes the request, **Then** the system declines the request with an explanation about maintaining factual accuracy

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user requests contradictory changes in succession (e.g., "add leadership skills" then "remove all leadership mentions")?
- How does the system handle ambiguous requests like "make it better" without specific guidance?
- What occurs when the chat session is interrupted or times out before changes are saved?
- How does the system respond to requests that would exceed resume length best practices (e.g., adding too many skills)?
- What happens when a user tries to access chat for a resume that hasn't been optimized yet?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Epic 1: Chat Interface Access
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visible chat interface entry point on the optimized resume view page
- **FR-002**: System MUST restrict chat access to resumes that have completed the AI optimization process
- **FR-003**: System MUST display chat interface as a sidebar panel on the right side of the optimized resume view page
- **FR-004**: System MUST initialize chat sessions with context about the current resume and original job description

#### Epic 2: Conversational AI Interaction
- **FR-005**: System MUST accept natural language input for resume amendment requests via text chat
- **FR-006**: System MUST process requests to add content (skills, experiences, certifications, education details)
- **FR-007**: System MUST process requests to modify existing content (rewording, formatting, emphasis changes)
- **FR-008**: System MUST process requests to remove or de-emphasize content sections
- **FR-009**: System MUST respond to user chat messages within 7 seconds (note: actual resume changes and updates may require additional processing time beyond initial response)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain factual accuracy and MUST NOT fabricate skills, experience, or qualifications not provided by user

#### Epic 3: Resume Version Management
- **FR-011**: System MUST create a new resume version with each successful amendment via chat
- **FR-012**: System MUST link chat-amended resumes to their parent optimization record for tracking
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to preview proposed changes before confirming application to resume
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide visual diff or change highlighting showing what was modified
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to undo individual chat amendments and revert to previous versions

#### Epic 4: Conversation History and Persistence
- **FR-016**: System MUST save all chat messages and corresponding resume changes for each session
- **FR-017**: System MUST display conversation history chronologically with user messages and AI responses
- **FR-018**: System MUST persist chat sessions for 30 days from last activity before automatic deletion
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow users to close and reopen chat sessions without losing conversation context
- **FR-020**: System MUST link chat sessions to specific optimization records for multi-resume management

#### Epic 5: Input Validation and Safety
- **FR-021**: System MUST validate amendment requests for appropriateness and relevance to resume content
- **FR-022**: System MUST reject requests that would create false or misleading information
- **FR-023**: System MUST handle unclear or ambiguous requests by asking clarifying questions
- **FR-024**: System MUST enforce content length limits to maintain professional resume standards (e.g., 1-2 pages)
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide helpful error messages when requests cannot be processed

### Key Entities

- **Chat Session**: Represents an interactive conversation between user and AI for refining a specific optimized resume, containing session start time, last activity timestamp, associated optimization record, active/closed status, conversation context, and 30-day retention policy from last activity
- **Chat Message**: Represents individual messages within a chat session, including sender (user or AI), message text, timestamp, and optional metadata like amendment type or resume section affected
- **Resume Version**: Represents a snapshot of resume content at a specific point in time, linked to parent optimization and chat session that created it, with version number and change summary
- **Amendment Request**: Represents a user's specific change request extracted from chat messages, categorized by type (add, modify, remove), target section, and processing status
