## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A job seeker uploads their existing resume (PDF or Word document), inputs a specific job description they want to apply for (either by pasting text or providing a URL), and receives an AI-optimized version of their resume that is tailored to match the job requirements while maintaining ATS-friendly formatting for successful application tracking system processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a resume file and job description, **When** they upload the resume and input the job description, **Then** they receive an optimized resume within 20 seconds showing improved keyword matching and relevant skills highlighting
2. **Given** a user wants to preview their optimized resume, **When** they complete the optimization process, **Then** they can view the optimized content in multiple professional templates before downloading
3. **Given** a free-tier user has completed one optimization, **When** they attempt a second optimization, **Then** they are presented with a paywall to upgrade to premium access
4. **Given** a user inputs a job description URL, **When** the system processes the link, **Then** relevant job information (title, company, requirements) is automatically extracted and cleaned for optimization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded resume files are corrupted or exceed 10MB size limit?
- How does system handle job descriptions with minimal content or non-standard formatting?
- What occurs when AI optimization takes longer than 20-second timeout limit?
- How does system respond when external job description URLs are inaccessible or blocked?
