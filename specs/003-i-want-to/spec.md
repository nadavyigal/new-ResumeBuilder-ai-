## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
After a job seeker has uploaded their resume and received an AI-optimized version tailored to a specific job description, they want to present their resume in a visually appealing format that stands out to recruiters. The system applies one recommended design by default, and users can browse all available templates to select their preferred option. Users can further customize the design through conversational AI chat (e.g., "make the headers blue", "use a more compact layout", "change the font to something more professional"), with changes applied immediately and an undo option available to revert the last change or reset to the original template.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed resume optimization, **When** they view their resume, **Then** they see their resume rendered with 1 AI-recommended design applied by default
2. **Given** a user wants to explore other designs, **When** they access the design browser, **Then** they see all available design templates with previews using their actual content
3. **Given** a user is browsing designs, **When** they click on a different design option, **Then** the system displays a full-page preview of their resume in that design
4. **Given** a user has selected a design, **When** they open the AI chat interface and request design modifications (e.g., "change the color scheme to blue and gray"), **Then** the system applies the changes immediately to the resume preview
5. **Given** a user doesn't like a recent design change, **When** they click the undo button, **Then** the system reverts to the previous design state
6. **Given** a user wants to start over, **When** they select "revert to original template", **Then** the system resets the design to the initial AI-recommended template
7. **Given** a user has finalized their design, **When** they export the resume, **Then** the exported PDF/DOCX reflects the selected design with all customizations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user requests a design change that conflicts with ATS-friendliness (e.g., "add images and graphics")? ‚Üí System rejects and guides user to ATS-compatible alternatives
- How does the system handle design change requests that are technically infeasible or unclear (e.g., "make it look cooler")? ‚Üí AI provides clarifying questions or suggests specific design options
- What if a user switches between designs after making customizations? ‚Üí Customizations are reset to the new template's defaults
- What happens if design rendering fails for a specific template? ‚Üí System falls back to default minimal template
- What if a user makes multiple changes and wants to undo more than the last one? ‚Üí Only last change is undoable; user must revert to original template for full reset
- Can users undo after saving their final design? ‚Üí Undo only available during active design session, not after returning later

- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to select any design as their active template

**Design Preview**
- **FR-005**: System MUST show a full-page preview of the selected design with user's content

**Design Persistence**
- **FR-014**: System MUST save the user's selected design and all customizations as a single final version

### Key Entities

- **Design Template**: Represents a visual style/layout for presenting resume content (name, category, preview thumbnail, is_premium flag, ATS compatibility level, supported customization options)

- **Design Customization**: Represents user-specific modifications to a base design template (template_id, color_scheme, font_family, spacing_settings, layout_variant, applied_at timestamp)

- **Resume Design Assignment**: Links an optimized resume to a specific design with customizations (optimization_id, template_id, customization_id, is_active flag, version_number)

- **Design Change Request**: Represents a user's natural language request to modify design via chat (session_id, message_id, requested_change description, interpreted_parameters, status: pending/approved/rejected, applied_customization_id)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

**Dependencies**

- Requires PDF/DOCX export functionality to support multiple design templates

**Assumptions**
- Resume designs from external library (resume-style-bank) are compatible with current resume data schema
- Design templates use React SSR pattern and can be integrated into Next.js application
- AI chat system (OpenAI GPT-4) can interpret design modification requests with appropriate prompting
- Users understand that design changes must maintain ATS compatibility (no images, tables, graphics)
