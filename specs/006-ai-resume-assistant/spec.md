# Feature Specification: AI Resume Assistant

**Feature Branch**: `006-ai-resume-assistant`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI Resume Assistant - Interactive content editing, visual customization, job-aware optimization, and application history tracking"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- **SCOPE CHANGE**: User Story 2 (Job-Aware Optimization and ATS Scoring) already exists and works well - removed from spec as it doesn't need implementation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Interactive Content Editing with AI Assistance (Priority: P1)

A user uploads their resume and a job description, then interacts with an AI assistant to refine specific content sections (e.g., "make this bullet point more impactful" or "add project management keywords to my last position"). The AI suggests professional phrasing, ATS-friendly keywords, and improvements while maintaining truthfulness—never inventing achievements, only reframing existing experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the AI Resume Assistant. Without interactive content editing, there's no AI assistant. This delivers immediate, tangible value to users by helping them improve their resume content through conversational interaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a resume and job description, asking the AI to improve a specific section (e.g., "make my leadership skills more prominent in my last job"), and verifying the AI provides relevant suggestions without fabricating information. Delivers standalone value as a content improvement tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has uploaded a resume and job description, **When** they ask "rewrite my second bullet point to emphasize leadership," **Then** the AI provides 2-3 alternative phrasings that highlight leadership using existing content
2. **Given** a user wants to add skills, **When** they say "add project management skills to my experience section," **Then** the AI suggests where and how to incorporate those skills based on existing experience
3. **Given** a user provides a vague request, **When** they say "make it better," **Then** the AI asks clarifying questions like "Which section would you like to improve?" or "What aspect should I focus on?"
4. **Given** a resume lacks information for a requested change, **When** the user asks to add something not supported by existing content, **Then** the AI explains it cannot invent experience and asks for more context or suggests alternative approaches

### User Story 2 - Visual Resume Customization with Real-Time Preview (Priority: P2)

Users can request design changes through natural language (e.g., "change the background color to navy blue" or "use a two-column layout"). The AI applies these changes instantly with a real-time preview, supporting modifications to colors, fonts, layouts, headers, and text boxes.

**Why this priority**: Visual customization enhances the user experience and complements the content editing from P1. This allows users to not only improve content but also create visually appealing resumes that stand out.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting design changes like "make the header blue" or "change font to Arial," verifying the preview updates immediately, and confirming changes persist. Delivers standalone value as a visual customization tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a resume is displayed, **When** the user says "change background color to light gray," **Then** the preview updates immediately with the new background color
2. **Given** a user wants layout changes, **When** they request "switch to two-column layout," **Then** the resume reformats to two columns with appropriate content distribution
3. **Given** a user requests font changes, **When** they say "use Roboto font for headings," **Then** all heading elements update to Roboto and the change is visible in real-time
4. **Given** an invalid design request, **When** the user asks for something unsupported (e.g., "add dancing animations"), **Then** the AI politely explains the limitation and suggests available alternatives

### User Story 3 - Application History Tracking (Priority: P3)

When a user is satisfied with their optimized resume and clicks "Apply Resume," the system automatically saves a snapshot (PDF + JSON metadata) including the optimized version, job title, company name, application date, ATS score, and contact information. This creates a searchable history dashboard where users can view, compare, and re-download previous applications.

**Why this priority**: History tracking is valuable for organization and record-keeping but doesn't directly improve resume quality. Users can benefit from all other features without this. It's a quality-of-life improvement for users managing multiple applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by optimizing a resume, clicking "Apply Resume," and verifying the entry appears in the history dashboard with all metadata. Users can download the saved version and compare it with the current resume. Delivers standalone value as an application management tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has optimized a resume for a job, **When** they click "Apply Resume," **Then** the system saves a PDF snapshot, stores metadata (job title, company, date, ATS score), and shows a success confirmation
2. **Given** a user has multiple saved applications, **When** they access the History Dashboard, **Then** they see a list of all applications with job title, company, date, and ATS score, sorted by date
3. **Given** a saved application in history, **When** the user clicks "View," **Then** they see the full resume preview and metadata details
4. **Given** a saved application, **When** the user clicks "Download," **Then** they receive the exact PDF version that was saved at application time
5. **Given** missing metadata fields (e.g., no contact person), **When** saving an application, **Then** the system saves all available fields and marks missing ones as "N/A"

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle ambiguous AI requests like "make it professional"?
  - AI asks clarifying questions: "Which section should I focus on?" or "What aspect of professionalism—tone, format, or keywords?"

- What if a user requests changes that contradict each other (e.g., "add more detail" then "make it shorter")?
  - AI acknowledges the contradiction and asks the user to prioritize

- How does the system handle resume formats that don't parse correctly?
  - Show partial parsing results and allow manual input/correction of missing sections

- How does the system prevent users from saving duplicate applications to history?
  - Check for matching job title + company + date and prompt user to confirm if duplicate detected

- What if a user tries to apply design changes unsupported by the current template?
  - AI explains the limitation and suggests alternative approaches or compatible templates
