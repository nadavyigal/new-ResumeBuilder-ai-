## Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

### 1. Authorization Bypass in Download API ✅
**Risk:** CRITICAL → RESOLVED

**What Was Fixed:**
- Added user authentication check
- Added ownership verification with `.eq("user_id", user.id)`
- Returns 401 for unauthenticated, 404 for unauthorized access

**File:** `src/app/api/download/[id]/route.ts`

**Impact:** Prevents users from downloading other users' resume optimizations

---

### 2. Race Condition in Quota System ✅
**Risk:** HIGH → RESOLVED

**What Was Fixed:**
- Created atomic PostgreSQL RPC function `increment_optimizations_used()`
- Replaced check-then-act pattern with single transaction
- Database migration applied successfully

**Files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251025070206_atomic_quota_increment.sql`
- `src/app/api/upload-resume/route.ts`

**Impact:** Free users can no longer bypass the 1-optimization limit

---

### 3. Unsafe Environment Variable Access ✅
**Risk:** CRITICAL → RESOLVED

**What Was Fixed:**
- Created centralized `src/lib/env.ts` with validation
- All env vars now validated with clear error messages
- Updated all files to use validated exports

**Files:**
- `src/lib/env.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`

- Development-only debug logging

**Impact:** Production error tracking and better debugging

---

### 13. Fixed Duplicate Supabase Clients ✅

**What Was Fixed:**
- Implemented singleton pattern for browser client
- Client created once, reused across all components
- Moved client creation outside AuthProvider component
