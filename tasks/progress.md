Project: ResumeBuilder AI (Web)
Status: Active
Current Phase: ATS scoring pipeline error sweep — LinkedIn scrape-blocking fix implemented, awaiting production verification on Vercel preview
Active Story: Verify the LinkedIn guest-endpoint fix from a real Vercel datacenter IP (branch fix/linkedin-guest-scrape) — set SCRAPE_CHECK_TOKEN on the preview, hit /api/debug/scrape-check, confirm aboutLen>1000 & isThin:false; then re-optimize a fresh LinkedIn job on iOS and confirm the score lifts above ~21
Last Completed Story: Implemented LinkedIn guest-API scrape fix + thinness gate (branch fix/linkedin-guest-scrape, pushed 2026-06-20) — root-cause fix for the score-capping bug
Next Recommended Story: After preview verification passes, merge fix/linkedin-guest-scrape and remove (or keep 404-gated) the debug route; only revisit a residential proxy if LinkedIn 429s the Vercel IP at scale (fetchHtml() seam is ready)
Estimated Completion: Web is live; launch-support items above remain
Blockers: —
Risks: Guest-endpoint behavior on Vercel's IP is verified-by-design but not yet confirmed from a real datacenter IP (only reproducible post-deploy); PDF/DOCX upload smoke test still not run (#1 pre-approval risk per tasks/MEMORY.md 2026-06-08); user_credits table vs profiles.credit_balance reconciliation must be resolved at Gate A
Last Validation: fix/linkedin-guest-scrape — 8 new unit tests pass, relevant suites 24/24, lint 0 errors (2026-06-20). The 16 other failing jest suites are pre-existing (Playwright e2e under jest + server-dependent contract tests), confirmed by stash-and-rerun on baseline.

## 2026-06-20 — Resumely ATS claim defensibility (copy/positioning, branch claude/angry-murdock-dd0e58)
Implemented approved decision "Resumely ATS Claim Defensibility": the score is a self-defined **Resumely Match Score**, never an external ATS vendor's score. Copy/label/translation-only — no scoring logic or API changes.
- Renamed user-facing "ATS score"/"ATS Score" labels to "Match Score"/"Match" across both locale layers (base `src/messages/{en,he}.json` + funnel overrides `src/messages-overrides/funnel/{en,he}.json`), keeping "ATS" only in descriptive/SEO contexts.
- Added score explainer microcopy `landing.score.explainer` ("Based on formatting + keyword match vs the job you paste. Not affiliated with any ATS vendor." / Hebrew equiv), rendered under the score in `ATSScoreDisplay.tsx`.
- Audit fixes: removed "beat ATS filters"/"Beats ATS filters"/"land more interviews" and "your ATS score" possessive framing from newsletter, hero social proof, share messages, OG image, and `atsCheckerPage` meta. No named ATS vendors found anywhere.
- Hardcoded labels fixed: `ats-resume-template.tsx` ("ATS Match Score"→"Match Score"), `opengraph-image.tsx`.
- 7 files changed. Validation: `npm run lint` 0 errors; `npm run check:i18n` 0 missing in HE / 0 invalid; tsc errors are pre-existing in `tests/` only (none in touched files).
- Flagged, kept for SEO/scope: funnel hero H1 "Pass ATS Filters" and meta.title "...See If Your Resume Passes".

## 2026-06-18 — ATS PDF fix merged + smoke passed
fix/pdf-parser-unpdf merged to main (PR #74). unpdf resolves the Vercel 500. Render-preview remains parked.

## 2026-06-19 — ATS JD pipeline fix merged (PR #76); score-capping bug only partially closed
fix/ats-jd-pipeline merged to main (PR #76, commit 7a91c8c). Scorer now falls back to qualifications/responsibilities and re-extracts from JD text when parsed_data.requirements is null — fixes the initial /api/optimize creation path. CI/lint/Vercel all green.

Cloudflare Workers Build "match1resume1to1job" check failed on this merge — verified it fails identically on PR #72, #73, #74, #75 too, and this repo has no wrangler.toml. Stale/orphaned Git integration, unrelated to this app. Not a regression; candidate for disconnecting later.

Found while verifying live: the fix does not fully close the score-capping bug.
1. GET /api/v1/optimizations/[id] (iOS diagnosis screen) reads persisted ats_score_original/ats_score_optimized columns and never recomputes — so any optimization created before 08:40 UTC today will keep showing its old, pre-fix score forever. Re-running /api/optimize on a fresh job is required to see the fix.
2. PUT /api/v1/optimizations/[id] (save-edit path) calls scoreOptimization() without jobExtractedJson, so it falls back to extractJobRequirements()'s naive text parsing instead of buildJobDataFromExtractedJson()'s structured fallback — meaning saves/re-scores through this path still don't benefit from PR #76.

Next: confirm with a brand-new optimize run (not a re-opened old one) whether the score lifts; if it does, file a follow-up to wire job_extracted_json into the save-path scoreOptimization() call in src/app/api/v1/optimizations/[id]/route.ts.

## 2026-06-19 — Save-path resolver gap fixed; real root cause found (LinkedIn scrape blocking)
Fixed commit 85505a3: PUT /api/v1/optimizations/[id] now selects parsed_data and forwards it as jobExtractedJson to scoreOptimization(), so manual edits/re-scores get the same structured fallback as the initial optimize path. Lint clean, ats-prepare-input.test.ts passes (4/4).

Founder re-ran a fresh optimization live (not a cached one) on the Base44 Partnership Manager LinkedIn job and the score was still 21/100 — confirmed via Supabase (optimizations row created 14:38 UTC, well after the PR #76 deploy). Pulled job_descriptions.parsed_data for that row: every field (requirements, qualifications, responsibilities, nice_to_have) is null, and clean_text/raw_text are both exactly 222 chars — the truncated og:description meta tag.

Direct curl of the identical LinkedIn URL from this machine returned the full page (260KB) with the show-more-less-html section intact (2,950 chars, "Job Description" + "Qualifications" bullet lists, no authwall). The production scraper (src/lib/scraper/jobExtractor.ts, fetched from Vercel's serverless egress) is getting a stripped-down version of the same page — almost certainly LinkedIn anti-bot serving degraded content to flagged datacenter/cloud IP ranges. No error is thrown (200 OK), so it fails silently into a near-empty job_data.

This means PR #76's resolver and the save-path fix above are both correct and necessary, but neither can fix this specific failure mode — there's no real text to fall back to. Founder decision 2026-06-19: park this, do not add a scraping-proxy dependency without explicit approval. If revisited, options are (a) a residential-IP proxy service (new paid dependency) or (b) detect thin scrapes and prompt the user to paste the JD manually instead of silently scoring against the meta snippet.
