# Project Progress

Project: ResumeBuilder AI (Web)
Status: Active
Current Phase: ATS scoring accuracy — root-caused the persistent low scores to multiple compounding causes (NOT a deploy gap). Fixed the substring-keyword bug; larger levers (JD structured-requirement extraction, AI-optimizer metric quality) remain.
Active Story: Land the keyword-substring fix (branch claude/nostalgic-euclid-564122) — extractKeywords no longer matches tech terms as substrings. Verified against real prod data (Fresha BD optimization d30a6841 / jd 42dc3790).
Last Completed Story: Diagnosed why scores stay low despite the merged LinkedIn + Layer B fixes. Confirmed prod is fresh (1h-old deploy on git-main alias, www.resumelybuilderai.com). Reproduced score 34 with exact inputs; found must_have = ["rust","express","api","Fresha\nAbout","Trusted"] from unbounded substring matching in extractKeywords. Fixed + tested.
Next Recommended Story: Decide direction with founder (product call). Two highest-ROI levers: (A) extract real requirement/qualification bullets from the LinkedIn guest fragment — parsed_data.requirements/qualifications/responsibilities are ALL null even when about_this_job is full (6KB), so the scorer falls back to a noisy keyword proxy; (B) AI-optimizer writes metric-free achievement bullets (metrics_presence legitimately = 0), so the optimize prompt needs to enforce quantified results.
Estimated Completion: Web is live; scoring-accuracy work is incremental
Blockers: Direction decision — "low scores" can mean improve extraction accuracy OR re-weight the model (keyword_phrase is structurally ~0 by design; 12% weight). Needs founder input before touching weights, given the "defensible Resumely Match Score" positioning.
Risks: keyword_phrase analyzer (12%) requires verbatim 3-6 word n-gram overlap — near-0 for any paraphrased resume; this is a design weakness, not a bug. metrics_presence (10%) correctly penalizes metric-free AI output.
Last Validation: claude/nostalgic-euclid-564122 — 3 new keyword-extraction tests + 24/24 ATS unit suites pass, lint clean, tsc no new errors (21 pre-existing, none in touched files). Real-data repro: keyword_exact 25→33 after fix (2026-06-21).

## 2026-06-18 — ATS PDF fix merged + smoke passed
fix/pdf-parser-unpdf merged to main (PR #74). unpdf resolves the Vercel 500. Render-preview remains parked.

## 2026-06-19 — ATS JD pipeline fix merged (PR #76); score-capping bug only partially closed
fix/ats-jd-pipeline merged to main (PR #76, commit 7a91c8c). Scorer now falls back to qualifications/responsibilities and re-extracts from JD text when parsed_data.requirements is null — fixes the initial /api/optimize creation path. CI/lint/Vercel all green.

Cloudflare Workers Build "match1resume1to1job" check failed on this merge — verified it fails identically on PR #72, #73, #74, #75 too, and this repo has no wrangler.toml. Stale/orphaned Git integration, unrelated to this app. Not a regression; candidate for disconnecting later.

Found while verifying live: the fix does not fully close the score-capping bug.
1. GET /api/v1/optimizations/[id] (iOS diagnosis screen) reads persisted ats_score_original/ats_score_optimized columns and never recomputes — so any optimization created before 08:40 UTC today will keep showing its old, pre-fix score forever. Re-running /api/optimize on a fresh job is required to see the fix.
2. PUT /api/v1/optimizations/[id] (save-edit path) calls scoreOptimization() without jobExtractedJson, so it falls back to extractJobRequirements()'s naive text parsing instead of buildJobDataFromExtractedJson()'s structured fallback — meaning saves/re-scores through this path still don't benefit from PR #76.

Next: confirm with a brand-new optimize run (not a re-opened old one) whether the score lifts; if it does, file a follow-up to wire job_extracted_json into the save-path scoreOptimization() call in src/app/api/v1/optimizations/[id]/route.ts.

## 2026-06-21 — Persistent low scores root-caused: NOT a deploy gap; multi-causal scoring bug
Investigated why the founder still sees low scores despite the LinkedIn guest-scrape + Layer B fixes being merged.

Decisive findings (evidence from prod Supabase + Vercel):
1. **Not a deploy gap.** Latest production deploy is 1h old and carries the `git-main` alias (→ www.resumelybuilderai.com). Production tracks main.
2. **The LinkedIn guest scrape now WORKS.** Fresha BD job (opt d30a6841, created 2026-06-21 08:49 AFTER all fixes) has raw_text/clean_text = 6371 chars. The thin-scrape problem is solved for this job. (The older Base44 job f3a1f852 with 222 chars predates the Jun-20 fix.)
3. **Real remaining bug = garbage keyword extraction.** parsed_data.requirements/qualifications/responsibilities are ALL null even with full about_this_job, so the scorer falls back to `extractJobData` on prose → `extractKeywords`. That function matched tech terms as substrings (no word boundaries): `rust`⊂"trusted", `api`⊂"rapidly", `express`⊂"expressing", `go`⊂"Google". For the BD role must_have came out `["rust","express","api","Fresha\nAbout","Trusted"]` → keyword_exact=25, keyword_phrase=0 → overall 34.

Fix (this branch): word-bound the tech-term matching with alphanumeric lookarounds + stop capitalized phrases spanning newlines. Real-data repro: keyword_exact 25→33. Lint/tsc/24 ATS tests green.

Honest scope note — the substring fix is necessary but only lifts ~2 pts. The dominant drags are: (a) JD structured requirements never extracted (Bug A, scraper); (b) keyword_phrase structurally ~0 (verbatim n-gram design, 12%); (c) metrics_presence legitimately 0 because the AI optimizer writes metric-free bullets (10%). Resolving "low scores" fully is a product decision — see keyed block "Next Recommended Story" / "Blockers".

## 2026-06-19 — Save-path resolver gap fixed; real root cause found (LinkedIn scrape blocking)
Fixed commit 85505a3: PUT /api/v1/optimizations/[id] now selects parsed_data and forwards it as jobExtractedJson to scoreOptimization(), so manual edits/re-scores get the same structured fallback as the initial optimize path. Lint clean, ats-prepare-input.test.ts passes (4/4).

Founder re-ran a fresh optimization live (not a cached one) on the Base44 Partnership Manager LinkedIn job and the score was still 21/100 — confirmed via Supabase (optimizations row created 14:38 UTC, well after the PR #76 deploy). Pulled job_descriptions.parsed_data for that row: every field (requirements, qualifications, responsibilities, nice_to_have) is null, and clean_text/raw_text are both exactly 222 chars — the truncated og:description meta tag.

Direct curl of the identical LinkedIn URL from this machine returned the full page (260KB) with the show-more-less-html section intact (2,950 chars, "Job Description" + "Qualifications" bullet lists, no authwall). The production scraper (src/lib/scraper/jobExtractor.ts, fetched from Vercel's serverless egress) is getting a stripped-down version of the same page — almost certainly LinkedIn anti-bot serving degraded content to flagged datacenter/cloud IP ranges. No error is thrown (200 OK), so it fails silently into a near-empty job_data.

This means PR #76's resolver and the save-path fix above are both correct and necessary, but neither can fix this specific failure mode — there's no real text to fall back to. Founder decision 2026-06-19: park this, do not add a scraping-proxy dependency without explicit approval. If revisited, options are (a) a residential-IP proxy service (new paid dependency) or (b) detect thin scrapes and prompt the user to paste the JD manually instead of silently scoring against the meta snippet.
