# Contract Tests â€” Plan

Overall Progress: `100%`

## Tasks:

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 1: Contracts test harness
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Create `tests/contracts` folder structure
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add npm script `test:contracts` (Jest filter)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Reuse existing Jest setup and path aliases

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 2: Legacy endpoints contract test
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add `tests/contracts/legacy-endpoints.test.ts`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Use representative sample payload for shape assertion
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Assert legacy shape; allow optional `meta.agentResult`

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 3: AgentResult schema contract test
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add `tests/contracts/agent-result-schema.test.ts`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Invoke runtime with acceptance command
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Validate response against Zod `AgentResultSchema`

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 4: Diff safety guarantees
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add `tests/contracts/diff-safety.test.ts`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Ensure no deletion diffs emitted by default (no after=="" with before present)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© V1 emits no explicit delete ops

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 5: Execution
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add run command `npm run test:contracts`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Tests are hermetic and schema-focused
