# Week 1 Social Distribution (Where + What to Post)

Use dates: 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-20  
Primary CTA in every post: `Run a free ATS check`

## Where To Share (Start Here)
## English distribution
1. Your personal LinkedIn profile.
2. Your company LinkedIn page.
3. Reddit communities where resume feedback is accepted (for example: `r/resumes`, `r/careerguidance`, `r/jobs`).
4. X account (thread + short tactical posts).

## Hebrew distribution
1. Your personal LinkedIn profile in Hebrew.
2. Israeli job-seeker communities you already participate in (Facebook/Telegram/WhatsApp groups).
3. Hebrew-focused career communities and newsletter snippets.
4. Optional: relevant Slack/Discord communities where self-promotion rules allow value posts.

## Channel Notes
1. LinkedIn: strongest for trust and professional intent. Make this your main channel.
2. Reddit: post value-first content, avoid promotional framing, include CTA at the end.
3. X: use short tactical hooks and one clear link CTA.
4. Hebrew communities: use transcreated copy, not direct translation.
