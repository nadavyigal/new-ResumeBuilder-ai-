# Screenshot Briefs — Resumely

Source of truth for positioning is `.agents/product-marketing.md` (ResumeBuilder iOS repo).
Lead with Fit/Match and application package, not "ATS score." Keep "ATS" only in
process-descriptive contexts (ATS-friendly formatting).

## Format
- Size: 1320×2868 px (iPhone 6.9" Pro Max)
- Background: dark gradient (#0f0f0f → #1a1a2e) or match app theme
- Font: same as app (system UI or Inter)
- Headline: top of frame, 80–100px, bold, white
- Subheadline: below headline, 50px, grey (#aaaaaa)
- Device mockup: iPhone 15 Pro shell, centred, bottom 70% of frame

## Notes for Designer
- All screenshots should use real (or realistic) resume content — not Lorem Ipsum
- The "before" Match Score should look genuinely bad (62, red) to make the "after" (89, green) feel like a real win
- Use the same colour palette as the live app for visual consistency
- Export each frame as PNG, store at `launch-assets/aso/screenshots/`
