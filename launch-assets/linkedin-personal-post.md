I got tired of sending resumes into the ATS black hole.

Over the last few months I kept hearing the same story from friends: "I know I am qualified, but I never hear back." That pushed me to build something small at first - a free ATS score checker that shows how well your resume matches a job description and where the biggest gaps are.

After a lot of late nights (and more than a few false starts), the tool is now live. It is not perfect, but it is already helping people see what the ATS is actually looking for and how to fix it quickly.

I would love your honest feedback before I do a wider launch next week. If you have a resume handy, try it and tell me what felt confusing, broken, or surprisingly helpful.

If you are open to sharing feedback, I will happily return the favor on anything you are building.
