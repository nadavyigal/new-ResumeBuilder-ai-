# The 7 ATS Mistakes That Block Qualified Candidates

Many candidates get filtered out before a recruiter ever reads their resume. In most cases, the problem is not experience. It is signaling.

If your resume is hard for an ATS to parse or hard for a recruiter to scan, you lose momentum early. This guide covers the most common mistakes and how to fix them quickly.

## 1) Generic summary with no target role

If your summary does not name your target role and key strengths, ATS and recruiters struggle to place you.

Fix:

- State the role you are pursuing.
- Add 2-3 role-critical strengths.
- Keep it specific to the job family.

## 2) Missing role language from the job description

You might have relevant experience but still miss matching terms.

Fix:

- Mirror accurate terms from the target job post.
- Add those terms in `Skills` and in `Experience` bullets.
- Avoid stuffing. Use context and outcomes.

## 3) Weak bullets that describe activity, not impact

ATS can index keywords, but recruiters decide based on proof.

Fix:

- Rewrite bullets with clear action and measurable impact.
- Replace vague verbs with concrete outcomes.

## 4) Inconsistent section structure

When section names are unclear or mixed, parse quality drops.

Fix:

- Use standard sections: `Summary`, `Skills`, `Experience`, `Education`.
- Keep chronology consistent.

## 5) Design-heavy formatting that hurts parseability

Complex layouts can hide key data in parsing.

Fix:

- Use one-column structure.
- Avoid tables and text boxes for core content.
- Keep contact info in the body, not decorative headers.

## 6) Skills list without evidence

A long skills list without usage examples creates low confidence.

Fix:

- Keep skills relevant to the target role.
- Prove key skills in experience bullets.

## 7) Same resume for every application

A generic resume lowers role match quality.

Fix:

- Tailor summary, skills emphasis, and top bullets to each role.
- Prioritize edits that affect match score first.

## Quick weekly workflow

Use this sequence before each application:

1. Match resume against one target job description.
2. Fix top ATS blockers first.
3. Rewrite 3-5 bullets for role fit and clarity.
4. Recheck score and submit.

## Final note

Most ATS issues are fixable in under an hour when you prioritize correctly. Start with high-impact blockers, then iterate.
